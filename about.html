                    Blackpink (Hangul: 블랙핑크; commonly stylized as BLACKPINK or BLΛƆKPIИK) is a South Korean girl group
                    formed by YG Entertainment, consisting of members Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa. They debuted on
                    August 8, 2016 with their single album Square One, which spawned "Whistle" and "Boombayah", their
                    first number-one hits in South Korea and on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart,
                    respectively.
                    <br><br>
                    Blackpink is the highest-charting female Korean act on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 33
                    with their 2020 single "How You Like That" and collaboration with Lady Gaga "Sour Candy". They also
                    peaked at number 22 on the Billboard 200 with their extended play "Kill This Love." They were the
                    first Korean girl group
                    to enter and top Billboard's Emerging Artists chart and to have three number-one singles on
                    Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart.
                    <br><br>
                    Blackpink became the first female Korean act to receive a certification from the Recording Industry
                    Association of America for their 2018 hit single "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du", which is the most-viewed Korean
                    group music video on YouTube at 1.2B views. The group has the most top 40 hits in the United Kingdom
                    among
                    all Korean artists, with "Kiss and Make Up" (in collaboration with Dua Lipa) being the first-ever
                    song by a Korean group to receive a
                    certification from the British Phonographic Industry. The single was also the first-ever
                    song by a Korean group to be certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association.
                    <br><br>
                    The group has broken numerous online records throughout their career; "Kill This Love" (2019) and
                    "How You Like That" each set a record for the most-viewed music video within the first 24 hours of
                    release, with the latter setting four other Guinness World Records and becoming the fastest Korean
                    track to reach double platinum on QQ Music, China's biggest music streaming platform.
                    <br><br>
                    Blackpink's accolades also include the New Artist of the Year Awards at the 31st Golden Disc Awards
                    and
                    the 26th Seoul Music Awards and recognition as the most powerful celebrities in South Korea by
                    Forbes Korea in 2019. The group was also the first female Korean group to be included in Forbes'
                    30 Under 30 Asia list.
                    <br><br>
                    They have performed on Coachella and have held concerts all over the world during their World Tour.
                    Blackpink is currently
                    the most-followed female group on Spotify and the most-subscribed music group
                    on YouTube with 41.7m subscribers.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to their musical accomplishments, the group has found success in various other facets as
                    well. All members have been and are currently endorsed by brands such as Chanel, Yves
                    Saint Laurent,
                    Celine, Dior, Samsung, Adidas, Sprite, Moonshot, and other establishments such as banks and cosmetic
                    companies.
                    Wielding massive influence individually and as a group, they quickly sell out products they endorse
                    and advertise. All four members are the most followed K-pop idols on Instagram and have a massive
                    following on other platforms such as Weibo, Vlive, and Tik Tok.
                    <br><br>
                    At present, the group is confirmed to release their first full-length album in September 2020.
                    Following the release of the album, members Rosé, Lisa, and Jisoo will release their
                    individual projects, with Rosé’s solo album releasing first. In the
                    midst of comeback preparations, YG Entertainment launched Blackpink's newest reality
                    show, "24/365 with Blackpink", which can be viewed through YouTube. The show documents their
                    comeback alongside sharing their daily lives through vlogs.

                            Roseanne, better known as Rosé, spent most of her early life in Melbourne,
                            Australia. She
                            had a
                            passion for singing even as a child and was performed with her church's choir.
                            In 2012,
                            Rosé's
                            father discovered an audition YG Entertainment was holding in Sydney, Australia.
                            Rosé
                            partook in
                            the audition and came in first, beating out 700 other auditions and became a
                            trainee under
                            YG
                            Entertainment the same day, training for 4 years. As Rosé is fluent in English,
                            Korean, and
                            Japanese, she often takes
                            over the role of speaking for the group during English presentations. As the
                            group's main
                            vocalist
                            Rosé's distinct vocal timbre is
                            largely met with praise. Other artists and critics note that her unique voice
                            can be easily
                            recognized and "is a type of voice young people love." She is also proficient at
                            playing the
                            piano and guitar and can be seen doing so on music shows and livestreams. Just
                            like with all
                            other BLACKPINK memebers, Rosé has appeared on many commercial films solo and
                            with the
                            group.
                            In 2020, she is officially the luxury brand Yves Saint Laurent's global
                            ambassador. Her solo
                            debut has been announced but has not been released yet. Rosé has a following of
                            more than
                            26.5m followers on her Instagram where she occasionally interacts with her fans
                            live.
